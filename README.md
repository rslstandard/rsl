# Really Simple Syndication (RSL)

**Really Simple Licensing (RSL)** is an open, XML-based standard that enables publishers and platforms to define **machine-readable licensing and usage terms** for digital assets on the web.

RSL enables content owners, platforms, crawlers, and agents to:
- Define machine-readable compensation and usage rules.  
- Automate license discovery, acquisition and payment.  
- Protect proprietary or paywalled content.  
- Promote transparency and compliance across the open web.

The specification is maintained by the [RSL Technical Steering Committee](https://rslstandard.org/about) and is currently in `draft`.

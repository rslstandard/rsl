# Really Simple Syndication (RSL)

The **Really Simple Licensing (RSL)** protocol is an open, collaborative initiative dedicated to defining standardized, machine-readable building blocks for expressing content licensing and compensation rules for how content is accessed and processed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) model development, deployment, and use.

The specification is [maintained](https://rslstandard.org/about) by the **RSL Technical Steering Committee** and is currently in `draft`.
